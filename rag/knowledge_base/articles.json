      "content": "Arm balances require strength, focus, and patience. Key poses include: Bakasana (Crow/Crane) - the gateway arm balance, Parsva Bakasana (Side Crow), Astavakrasana (Eight-Angle Pose), and Mayurasana (Peacock). Prerequisites: strong wrists, core strength, shoulder stability, and mental focus. Preparation includes: plank holds, chaturanga practice, core work, wrist stretches and strengthening. Tips: shift weight forward gradually, use gaze point for balance, engage core strongly, don't rush the process. Practice on padded surface initially. These poses build profound concentration, strengthen entire upper body, and develop mental resilience through facing fear of falling.",

These poses require: open shoulders, hip flexors, and thoracic spine; strong legs and arms; proper warm-up sequence. Benefits include: heart opening (physically and emotionally), increased energy, improved spine flexibility, and expanded breath capacity. Preparation: thorough warm-up with lunges, gentle backbends (Cobra, Bridge), shoulder openers. Practice: engage legs strongly, distribute curve throughout spine (not just lower back), breathe fully. These poses can bring emotional release as we open guarded areas.",

The Niyamas (personal observances): cleanliness, contentment, discipline, self-study, surrender. Asana: physical postures - just one limb! Pranayama: breath control and expansion of life force. Pratyahara: sense withdrawal, turning attention inward. Dharana: concentration on a single point. Dhyana: meditation, sustained focus without interruption. Samadhi: absorption, union, enlightenment. This framework shows yoga as far more than physical exercise - it's a complete system for living and spiritual development.",

Structure practice with: centering (seated breathing), warm-up (Cat-Cow, gentle stretches), standing poses, balance, seated poses, backbends, cooldown, Savasana. Use videos or sequences for guidance initially. Reduce distractions (phone off, door closed). Modify for how you feel each day - honor energy levels.
